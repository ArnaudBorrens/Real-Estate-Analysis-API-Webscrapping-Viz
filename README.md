# Real-Estate-Analysis
In this Python project, we'll use Web Scrapping, API calls, Data wrangling, and manipulation to determine the best neighborhoods to live in based on a set of hobbies.  For this, we'll use the city of Brussels, Belgium, the API of Foursquare, and the Folium package to display the matching neighborhoods on a map.
