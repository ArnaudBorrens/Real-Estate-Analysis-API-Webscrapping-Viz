# Real-Estate-Analysis
In this Python project we'll use Web Scrapping, API calls, and Data wrangling and manipulation to determine the best neighbourhoods to live in based on a set of hobbies.  For this we'll use the city of Brussels, Belgium, the API of Foursquare and the Folium package to display the matching neighbourhoods on a map.
